Realmart Sales Dashboard
This repository contains an interactive Excel dashboard and raw dataset focused on analyzing and visualizing sales performance for Realmart, a hypothetical retail company.

📌 Project Objective
The goal of this project is to transform raw sales data into actionable insights through an easy-to-use, interactive Excel dashboard.

Business users often struggle to understand their data when it’s buried in spreadsheets. This project bridges that gap by converting complex datasets into intuitive visualizations for informed decision-making.

❓ Why This Project
Retail organizations generate massive volumes of sales data every month. However:

Decision-makers lack quick visibility into KPIs.

Teams spend too much time on manual reporting.

Stakeholders often require custom views by region, product, or time period.

This project was built to:

Eliminate repetitive manual analysis.

Deliver real-time filtering and drill-downs.

Provide a scalable dashboard model anyone can replicate in Excel.
